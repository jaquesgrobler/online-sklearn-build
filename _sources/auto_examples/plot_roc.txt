=======================================
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
=======================================

Example of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric to evaluate
classifier output quality.

ROC curves typically feature true positive rate on the Y axis, and false
positive rate on the X axis. This means that the top left corner of the plot is
the "ideal" point - a false positive rate of zero, and a true positive rate of
one. This is not very realistic, but it does mean that a larger area under the
curve (AUC) is usually better.

The "steepness" of ROC curves is also important, since it is ideal to maximize
the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate.
